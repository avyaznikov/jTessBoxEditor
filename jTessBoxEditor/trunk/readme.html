            DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://vietocr.sourceforge.net">jTessBoxEditor</a> is a box editor for
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract OCR data</a>, providing
            editing of box data. It provides read support of common image formats, and multi-page images.</p>
        <h3>
            SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java Runtime Environment 6.0</a>
            or later.</p>
        <h3>
            INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            To launch the program:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <tt>java -jar jTessBoxEditor.jar</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            You would 
            need to provide the Tiff/box files as input to the program. Images to be OCRed 
            should be scanned at resolution from at least 200 DPI (dot per inch) to 400 DPI 
            in monochrome (black&amp;white) or grayscale. Scanning at higher resolutions will 
            not necessarily result in better recognition accuracy. The actual rates depends 
            largely on the quality of
            the scanned image. The typical settings for scanning are 300 DPI and 1 bpp (bit
            per pixel) black&amp;white or 8 bpp grayscale uncompressed TIFF or PNG format.</p>
        <p>
            The box files, in UTF-8 format, are generated by Tesseract executables 
            with appropriate command-line options. The
            training operation can be automated using the enclosed train.ps1 PowerShell 
            script.</p>
        <p>
            Note that the coordinate system used in the box file has (0,0) at the 
            bottom-left; on computer graphics devices, however, (0,0) is defined as top-left.
            jTessBoxEditor uses and displays in the graphics device coordinates. The edited 
            box files are still read and written in proper format.</p>
        <p>
            The editor supports both Tesseract 2.0x and 3.0x formats. For 2.0x, you will 
            need to delete &quot; 0&quot; sequence at the end of each line in the output box file 
            before proceeding with other next steps of the training process.</p>
